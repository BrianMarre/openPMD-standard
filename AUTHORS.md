### Original Design (2014)

- Axel Huebl (HZDR, a.huebl@hzdr.de)

*Acknowledgements:* the design of this standard is based on the experiences
                    we gained in the last years implementing efficient,
                    parallel I/O in several PIC codes, but most recently
                    in PIConGPU (picongpu.hzdr.de).
                    Special thanks goes to Felix Schmitt (ZIH, TU Dresden)
                    and Rene Widera (HZDR).
